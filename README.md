# Blogging Application Overview

This blogging application provides users with a platform to create, manage, and interact with blog posts. It includes a feature-rich backend built with **NestJS** and **MySQL**, and a user-friendly frontend built with **{*technology yet to be disclosed*}**. The application offers a robust, scalable, and secure environment for both content creators and readers.

## Key Features

### Backend (NestJS & MySQL)
The backend is designed to handle all data management, authentication, and business logic operations. It offers a range of services that support seamless interaction with the database and ensures high performance and security.

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users with different roles (e.g., admin, author, reader) have appropriate permissions.
- **Post Management**: Full CRUD functionality for blog posts. Users can create, update, and delete their own posts, while admins have broader control.
- **Comments & Nested Replies**: Users can leave comments on blog posts, with support for nested replies. Comments can be edited or deleted by the author.
- **Tagging System**: Posts can be categorized and filtered by tags, making content easily searchable.
- **REST API**: The backend exposes a well-documented API for managing users, posts, comments, and more. This API follows best practices for structure, validation, and error handling.
- **MySQL Database**: A relational database is used for storing structured data, including users, posts, comments, and tags. The database design ensures fast query performance with the use of indexing.
- **Security**: Data security is a priority, with features such as password hashing using **bcrypt**, secure token generation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and CSRF attacks.
- **Scalability**: The backend architecture is designed for scalability, with support for horizontal scaling, caching with **Redis**, and load balancing using **Nginx**.
- **Performance Optimization**: Features like pagination, caching, and efficient database queries ensure fast response times even under heavy load.

### Frontend (technology yet to be disclosed)
The frontend provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the blogging platform. Built with React, it offers a modern, responsive design and smooth user experience.

- **Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive design that works across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Content Creation and Management**: Authors can create, edit, and manage their posts through a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Interactive Comments**: Users can engage with content by commenting on posts and replying to other users.
- **Tag-based Navigation**: Users can filter and explore blog posts based on categories and tags.
- **Real-time Updates**: The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data in real time.
