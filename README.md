## 1. Overview
This is a blogging application backend, built using **NestJS** for its framework and **MySQL** for database storage. The backend serves a REST API for managing blog posts, users, and comments, while ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.

- **Purpose**: The system manages blog posts, users, and comments for a blogging platform.
- **Goals**: Provide a secure, fast, and scalable backend for handling user content.
- **Key Features**:
  - CRUD operations for blog posts.
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Comments on blog posts.

---

## 2. Components

### 2.1 Authentication Service
Handles user registration, login, and authorization.

- **Features**: 
  - Sign-up / Login (with JWT tokens).
  - Password hashing using **bcrypt**.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (admin, author, reader).

### 2.2 Blog Posts Service
Manages the creation, updating, and deletion of blog posts.

- **Features**:
  - Create, update, delete posts.
  - Associate tags and categories with posts.
  - Search and filter by tags and categories.

### 2.3 Comments Service
Allows users to comment on blog posts.

- **Features**:
  - Add comments on posts.
  - Edit/delete comments (only by the author).
  - Nested (threaded) comments.

### 2.4 User Management Service
Handles user data and roles.

- **Features**:
  - Retrieve and update user profiles.
  - Manage user roles (e.g., admin, author, reader).
  - List all users (admin-only).

---

## 3. API Design
Details of the API endpoints exposed by the backend.

- **Base URL**: `https://localhost:3000`

### 3.1 Authentication Endpoints
- **POST /auth/signup**: Register a new user.
- **POST /auth/login**: Authenticate and generate JWT token.

### 3.2 Blog Posts Endpoints
- **GET /posts**: Retrieve a list of blog posts.
- **POST /posts**: Create a new blog post (admin/author only).
- **PUT /posts/{id}**: Update a blog post by ID (admin/author only).
- **DELETE /posts/{id}**: Delete a blog post by ID (admin/author only).

### 3.3 Comments Endpoints
- **POST /posts/{id}/comments**: Add a comment to a blog post.
- **PUT /comments/{id}**: Update a comment (author only).
- **DELETE /comments/{id}**: Delete a comment (author only).

### 3.4 Users Endpoints
- **GET /users/{id}**: Retrieve a user profile by ID.
- **PUT /users/{id}**: Update a user profile (user only).

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate-limiting applied to prevent abuse (e.g., max 100 requests per minute).

---

## 4. Database Design
The backend uses MySQL for relational data storage. Below is the description of the key tables.

- **Users**: 
  - Columns: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`.
  - Stores registered user data.
  
- **Posts**:
  - Columns: `id`, `title`, `content`, `author_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
  - Stores blog posts authored by users.

- **Comments**:
  - Columns: `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `parent_id`.
  - Stores user comments on blog posts.

- **Tags**:
  - Columns: `id`, `name`.
  - Used to categorize posts.

- **Post_Tags** (Join table):
  - Columns: `post_id`, `tag_id`.
  - Many-to-many relationship between posts and tags.

## 5. Data Flow
### 5.1 Request Flow
1. **User Authentication**: A user sends login credentials to `/auth/login`. If successful, a JWT token is returned.
2. **API Request**: The user sends a request (e.g., to create a post) with the JWT token in the header.
3. **Authorization**: The request is checked for valid JWT and user roles.
4. **Business Logic Execution**: The requested operation (e.g., creating a post) is performed by the respective service.
5. **Database Interaction**: Data is stored or retrieved from the MySQL database.
6. **Response**: The system returns the result of the operation.

### 5.2 Response Flow
- The backend processes the request and returns a response, typically in JSON format, with status codes such as `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`.

---

## 6. Security Considerations
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: Store passwords using **bcrypt**.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict certain endpoints (e.g., post creation) to users with specific roles.
- **Input Validation**: Use validation pipes to sanitize and validate incoming data.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted over HTTPS.

---

## 7. Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Use Redis for caching frequently accessed resources (e.g., popular blog posts).
- **Database Indexing**: Use indexes on frequently queried fields like `author_id` and `post_id`.
- **Pagination**: Apply pagination for endpoints returning large datasets (e.g., posts or comments).
- **Load Balancing (implement in the future)**: Use Nginx for load balancing across multiple instances.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Logging
- **Global Exception Filters**: NestJS global exception filter to catch and handle errors across the app.
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `400 Bad Request`).
- **Logging**: Use NestJS `Logger` to log errors and significant events.
- **Alerting (implement in the future)**: Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to generate alerts on critical issues.

---

## 9. FUTURE: Scalability and Availability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Docker containers to scale the app horizontally by adding more instances.
- **Load Balancing**: Use Nginx for distributing traffic across multiple instances.
- **Database Replication**: MySQL replication for high availability and read scalability.

---

## 10. FUTURE: Deployment Strategy
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and deployments using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
- **Environment Setup**: Separate environments for development, staging, and production.
- **Zero Downtime Deployment**: Use rolling updates or blue-green deployments to ensure no downtime.

---

## 11. FUTURE: Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of the system.
- **Health Checks**: Implement NestJS health check endpoints to verify service status.
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logging using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

---

## 12. Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: TypeORM
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx
